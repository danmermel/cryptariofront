					<v-card-title>Homophones</v-card-title>
					<v-card-subtitle>And how to solve them</v-card-subtitle>
					<v-card-text>
						<p>With an homophone-type clue you are looking for a word that when spoken sounds like another word.</p>
						<p>Words that sound similar but mean different things are called homophones. For example the words deer and dear are homophones, as are the words read and reed.</p>
						<p>Here is a typical homophone-type clue</p>
						<p><b>Told about female deer's money (5)</b></p>

						<p>These clues generally consist of three parts:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The definition. This is the solution you are looking for, <b>Money</b> in the case above.</li>
							<li>A homophone "indicator" - This is a word (or words) that signal to the solver that the clue is in fact a homophone-type clue. Because homophone clues are about the sounds of things indicators tend to be words that convey something being heard, like <b>Told about</b> above.</li>
							<li>A clue to the word or words that, when said out loud, could also be heard as the solution word. In this case it is <b>female deer</b>.</li>
						</ol> 
						<br>
						<p>In the above clue a <b>doe</b> is a <b>female deer</b>. When you say it out loud, doe could also be <b>dough</b>, which is a synonym of <b>money</b>.</p>
						<p>Other homphone indicators are words like "I/We hear" or "reported".</p>

						<p>Now try this clue:</p>
						<v-list dense>
							<v-list-item>remained sober, so we hear (6)</v-list-item>
						</v-list>
						<p>If you are stumped, <a href="cryptic.html#remained%20sober,%20so%20we%20hear%20(6)">give it to the machine!</a></p>
