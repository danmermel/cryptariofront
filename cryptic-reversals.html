					<v-card-title>Reversals</v-card-title>
					<v-card-subtitle>And how to solve them</v-card-subtitle>
					<v-card-text>
						<p>In a reversal type clue you need to find a word that when reversed (i.e. read backwards) will produce another word. </p>
						<p>Here is a typical reversal-type clue:</p>
						<p><b>Extracted backward jeans (5)</b></p>

						<p>These clues generally consist of three parts:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The definition. This is the solution you are looking for, <b>Jeans</b> in the case above.</li>
							<li>A reversal "indicator" - This is a word (or words) that signal to the solver that the clue is in fact a reversal clue. Because reversals are all about reading things the other way, reversal indicators tend to be words that signify that, like <b>backwards</b> above.</li>
							<li>A clue to the word(s) that when read backwards result in the definition. In this case <b>Extracted</b>.</li>
						</ol> 
						<br>
						<p>In this case:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Extracted = <b>Mined</b>.</li>
							<li>Jeans = <b>Denim</b>.</li>
						</ul> 
						<p>Extracted, when read backwards, becomes Denim.</p>

						<p>There aren't that many words that read backwards into other words. So you tend to find reversal-type clues combined with other clues into a bigger clue.</p>
						<p>Now try this clue:</p>
						<v-list dense>
							<v-list-item>physician turns up fish (3)</v-list-item>
						</v-list>
						<p>If you are stumped, <a href="cryptic.html#physician%20turns%20up%20fish%20(3)">give it to the machine!</a></p>
