					<v-card-text>
						<p>A cryptic charade clue is perhaps the most common type of cryptic clue.</p>
						<p>In a charade clue, you find two or more words than when put together make another word.</p>
						<p>For example:</p>
						<p><b>Hang heavy like long stories (5)</b></p>

						<p>In this case:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Hang heavy = <b>Sag</b>.</li>
							<li>Like = <b>As</b>.</li>
						</ul> 
						<p>So if you put them together you get <b>Sagas</b> (long stories)</p>

						<p>Here's another example:</p>
						<p><b>Behold the wrath of the river (5)</b></p>

						<p>In this case:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Behold = <b>Lo!</b>.</li>
							<li>Wrath = <b>Ire</b>.</li>
						</ul> 
						<p>So if you put them together you get <b>Loire</b> (A river in France)</p>

						<p>The sheer amount of wordplay that goes on in charade clues make them extremely hard to solve by computer!</p>
						<p>But they are also some of the most satisfying once you have solved them!</p>
						<p>Now try this clue:</p>
						<v-list dense>
							<v-list-item>Obvious disagreement for defendant (9)</v-list-item>
						</v-list>
						<p>If you are stumped, <a href="cryptic.html#obvious%20disagreement%20for%20defendant%20(9)">give it to the machine!</a></p>
