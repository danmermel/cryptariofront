		  <p>A cryptic crossword is a special type of crossword where the clues are not straightforward definitions of a word, but consist of various forms of wordplay that obscure the meaning you're looking for.</p> 
		  <p>For example, whereas in a standard crossword the clue for Raisin might be <b>Dried fruit (7)</b>, in a cryptic crossword you might get something like <b>Dried fruit is found in the wet season (7)</b>.</p>
		  <p>The definition is still there, but it is hidden by a whole lot of other (apparently pointless) infromation.</p>
		  <p> The challenge then becomes trying to figure out which part of the clue is the definition and which part is designed to throw you off the scent.</p>
		  <p>Normally cryptic clues have two parts:
		  <v-list dense>
		    <v-list-item>The definition - Same as in a traditional crossword (e.g. "Dried fruit")</v-list-item>
		    <v-list-item>A subsidiary - additional information to solve the clue, but that also hides the true meaning and confuses you (e.g. "is found in the wet season")</v-list-item>
		  </v-list> </p>
		  <p>The job of the solver is to decide which bit is the definition and which is the subsidiary, and then to solve the clue.</p>
		  <p>In the above example <b>"Dried fruit"</b> is the definition, and <b>"is found in the wet season"</b> is the subsidiary.</p>
		  <p><b>So how do you solve it?</b></p>
		  <p>Well, the wet season is the rainy season, or the "Rains"</p>
		  <p>And the subsidiary also tells you that "is" is "found in" the wet season, so obviously you get ra<b>IS</b>ins (is inside rains).</p>

		  <p>Confused? Do not worry!</p>

		  <p>There are (a few) rules. For example, the definition will normally be found at the end or the beginning of the clue.</p>
		  <p>And there are types of clues and techniques to solve them.</p>
	  	  <p>Also, there is a lot of redundancy in the system - when you get an answer that fits all parts of the clue, it is very rarely wrong.</p>

		  <p><b>But beware:</b> Clues are written to make grammatical sense, but only to confuse you! Also, do not pay much heed to punctuation - itâ€™s normally just a red herring.</p>
