					<v-card-subtitle>And how to solve them</v-card-subtitle>
					<v-card-text>
						<p>With an subtraction-type clue you are looking for a word that, when having one or more letters removed, becomes another word.</p>
						<p>Here is a typical subtraction-type clue:</p>
						<p><b>Crime is the result when clergyman loses his head (5)</b></p>

						<p>These clues generally consist of three parts:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The definition. This is the solution you are looking for, <b>Crime</b> in the case above.</li>
							<li>A subtraction "indicator" - This is a word (or words) that signal to the solver that the clue is in fact a subtraction-type clue. Because subtractions are about removing  letters, subtraction indicators tend to be words like <b>loses head</b> above.</li>
							<li>A clue to the word or words that, when having something subtracted, result in the solution. In this case it is <b>clergyman</b>.</li>
						</ol> 
						<br>
						<p>In the above clue <b>Parson</b> is a synonym of <b>clergyman</b>. When you remove its head, i.e. its first letter, then you are left with <b>arson</b>, which is, of course, a <b>crime</b>.</p>
						<p>Often, as in this case, you will get a hint as to what you need to remove. "Tail" suggests removing the letter(s) at the end. "Heartless" might suggest removing letters in the middle.</p>
						<p>But just as often there are no hints... you just have to figure out what to remove!</p>

						<p>Now try this clue:</p>
						<v-list dense>
							<v-list-item>Observing naught, losing heart (6)</v-list-item>
						</v-list>
						<p>If you are stumped, <a href="cryptic.html#Observing%20naught,%20losing%20heart%20(6)">give it to the machine!</a></p>
