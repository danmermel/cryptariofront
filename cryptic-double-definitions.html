					<v-card-title>Double Definitions</v-card-title>
					<v-card-subtitle>And how to solve them</v-card-subtitle>
					<v-card-text>
						<p>A cryptic double definition is, as the name suggests, a type of clue where the solution is defined more than once.</p>
						<p>For example:</p>
						<p><b>Get out of the way of American city car (5)</b></p>

						<p>In this case</p>
						<ul>
							<li>American city car = <b>Dodge</b> (remember those?).</li>
							<li>Get out of the way = <b>Dodge</b>.</li>
						</ul> 
						<br>
						<p>Like with all other crpytic clues, the double definition may make grammatical sense as a full sentence, but that is always just a red herring.</p>
						<p>And beware, double definitions could even be triple definitions, as in:</p>
						<p><b>Procedure for making a hole in cloth (5)</b></p>
						<p>In this case</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Procedure = <b>(A) Drill</b>.</li>
							<li>Making a hole = <b>(To) Drill</b>.</li>
							<li>Cloth = <b>Drill</b>.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<p>Now try this clue:</p>
						<v-list dense>
							<v-list-item>Yearn for quite a while (4)</v-list-item>
						</v-list>
						<p>If you are stumped, <a href="cryptic.html#yearn%20for%20quite%20a%20while%20(4)">give it to the machine!</a></p>
